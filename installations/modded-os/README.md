# Modded OS

![](../../.gitbook/assets/moddedos_banner.png)

## What are Modded OS?

Modded OS are modified by us to achieve the maximum performance and we ship it with all the essential software pre-installed. Themes and icons are selected to match every element of the system. 

## When should I choose Modded OS?

Well, every time to don't want to keep yourself busy with optimizing things and fixing those theming issues, finding the correct PPA for the installation of the working version of the software. All-in-all, it allows you to enjoy Linux without making you do everything necessary.

## How do they look like?

You can take a look at our [Modded OS Gallery](https://andronix.app/modded-os-gallery/).

## How do I install these OS?

* You need to login into Andronix either with your Google account or email \(register if you already have an account\). Worried about your privacy? Read more here.
* After logging in, click on the Install button of your favourite distro.

**Confused** about which distribution to choose? here is a guide to help you out - _Modded OS Guide_
{% endhint %}

* If you haven't already purchased the distro, the app will prompt you to buy it first. You can proceed to the next step, if you already own the distro you want to install, else you can proceed to buy it.

{% hint style="info" %}
Modded OS are a **life-time purchase** and can be used on any number of devices.
{% endhint %}

_If already bought, the app will generate a one-time code for you to download the OS._

* That's it, let's proceed to the actual installation now. Click on the **Copy** button and paste the copied code in a **Termux shell**.
* Let it finish. The installation will take some time as these are much bigger than the normal \(un-modded OS\) because these have things pre-installed.
* When the download and extraction will finish, you'll be asked to input a **username**. You can choose any username unless that's a _reserved keyword like admin, root_ etc. \(your name works fine\).
