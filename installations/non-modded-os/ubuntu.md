# Ubuntu 19

This tutorial will guide you through the installation of Ubuntu 19.​![](https://gblobscdn.gitbook.com/assets%2F-M3GfCpTf-NQoVFdAEdy%2F-M3GfT3vN6iTZNGlRDQJ%2F-M3GggjnV9sNONolh6i6%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=69bc2adf-b666-4752-8317-24a1fc57e56a)

## Essential Information <a id="essential-information"></a>

Ubuntu provided by Andronix is open source including all the scripts needed for installing it. You can take a look at it [here](https://github.com/AndronixApp/AndronixOrigin).

**Download size** - 250MB

The size mentioned above is not the size after installing Ubuntu but it's just the tar size that Andronix downloads. **This doesn't include a desktop environment for the GUI**.

## How to install? <a id="how-to-install"></a>

* Open the [Andronix App](https://andronix.app/) and click on the Ubuntu card
* Click on **Install** and then select **Ubuntu 19**

​

* Now you will have a new sheet opened up with multiple options... The first three options will install Ubuntu 19 with the mentioned [Desktop Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment). The last **Non-DE** variant installs Ubuntu 19 without any Desktop Environment and is recommended for _pro-users_ only

​

* Now click on any _**one**_ button to copy the command. You can make sure that you have copied the command if a _green tick_ appears on the button as shown below

We recommend to choose XFCE variant as it is the most stable, smooth, advanced and customizable Desktop Environment present at the moment

​

* Now once you have copied the command successfully open [Termux](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en_US) and paste the command and hit enter.
* Now you just have to wait depending on your Internet connection speed. **We recommend to use Wifi connection or very stable internet connecntion as poor connection might result in various errors**
* Once the installation is complete you can start the Linux distro next time by command `./start-ubuntu19.sh`
