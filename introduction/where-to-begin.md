### How it all works?

Andronix is simple inside the hood \(well not really, but most of it is simple to understand\). Andronix uses **PRoot** to run your favourite Linux distribution on your Android devices.

#### What exactly is PRoot?

As stated in the official website of PRoot

> PRoot is a user-space implementation of **chroot, mount --bind, and binfmt\_misc**. This means that users don't need any privileges or setup to do things like using an arbitrary directory as the new root file system, making files accessible somewhere else in the file system hierarchy, or executing programs built for another CPU architecture transparently through QEMU user-mode.

or in easier words, the benefits of enabling PRoot include running Linux operating systems in a Termux [chroot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) on an Android smartphone and tablet, and Chromebook.

We use **Termux** to provide the command line and the packages that are especially compiled for Termux implemented inside Andronix.
