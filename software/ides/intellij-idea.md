## Installation

Here are the steps needed to install IntelliJ Idea on your Andronix instance

### APT

* Download the latest tar.gz file from JetBrains official [download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux). 
* After downloading the tar.gz, make sure that it is in your download folder and after run the following command.
